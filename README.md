# Cyber's Restaurants üçóüßáü•ì

## Description
Welcome to Cyber's Restaurants app! This app allows users to search for restaurants in any part of the world and returns a list of restaurants that are categorized by price. There are a total of four categories, those categories are the following: cost effective, pricy, expensive, and big spender. The user is able to tap on any resturant and find more information about that resturant. 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to make use of Yelp's API and getting more hands-on practice with React Native. This past year I decided to learn everything I possibly could about React Native. By the end of this project I'm expecting to learn more about APIs, UX, and feeling more comfortable with React Native.
